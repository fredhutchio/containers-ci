# An introduction to containers for continuous integration (in science).

## Synopsis
Software is an essential part of the scientific enterprise, and we need for it to work.
The software engineering practice of _continuous integration_ is to build and run tests whenever new code is pushed.
However, scientific workflows are complex, and standard continuous integration tools are not always a good fit.

In this short workshop I will present Docker as a useful tool for scientific continuous integration.
We will also take a look at [Wercker](http://wercker.com/), a continuous integration tool that can build on an arbitrary Docker image.


## Participating
If you want to try out Docker, bring a laptop and know how to SSH to a remote machine with it.
Alternatively, you can [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) on your laptop.
